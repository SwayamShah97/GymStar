As the pandemic restrictions are lifted and the public places are reopening, it is important to make sure that these places are safe and well sanitized. Our website helps to find a suitable Gym, posts reviews about it and schedules trial sessions. 

Users can browse the list of gyms and filter out the gym based on multiple filters like opening hours, location, ratings, membership cost and hygiene. Users can book a trial session at a particular gym and then submit a review about it to help other users choose better.
